Designing software for this 3D scene project involved transforming 2D concepts into a cohesive 3D representation by focusing on the balance of shapes and textures. I started by breaking down each object into simple shapes like spheres, cylinders, and prisms, which helped maintain a minimalist yet visually interesting scene. This approach allowed me to refine each shape’s purpose in the overall layout and apply different textures and lighting to enhance depth and realism. By planning each object’s function within the scene, I could ensure a balanced interaction between objects, which provided a structured yet creative foundation for the design.

Through this project, I strengthened my spatial reasoning and gained skills in creating scenes with both simple and complex elements. Transforming each object with lighting and textures gave me a better understanding of how design choices affect visual appeal and how basic shapes can convey different aesthetics and functionality. I also learned how to prioritize and implement visual depth without cluttering the scene, which has improved my ability to translate abstract concepts into concrete designs. These design insights will help in future projects by providing a streamlined method to handle both design complexity and user experience.

On the development side, I approached the project with an incremental method, focusing on individual objects before integrating them into the final scene. This modular approach made it easier to troubleshoot and refine each component individually, enabling a smoother assembly of the final product. Iteration was a constant part of this process, as I revisited the lighting, textures, and spatial relationships between objects to achieve the desired visual balance. This step-by-step strategy has evolved my coding approach, teaching me to prioritize robust, independent components for a cleaner, more efficient workflow.

Working on this 3D scene has not only enriched my technical skills in computational graphics but has also shown me the broader applications of these skills. Computational graphics has deepened my understanding of how visual design and technical knowledge intersect, which will be useful in future educational and professional settings, whether in game development, simulations, or data visualization. These skills will support my goal of creating user-centered, visually engaging applications and further my ability to think critically about both the technical and aesthetic aspects of software design.
